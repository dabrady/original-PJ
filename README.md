original Pokemon Java files from Spring 2012 (text-based)

Initially, this contains all the files used in development of our first version of PJ, which was being designed
as a purely text-based game. The plan is to pretty much scrap this version, now that we've decided to GUI, and
rebuild our game using this version as more or less reference material.

This repo will not be edited or modified once the files have been uploaded. Instead, a new repo will be created
for development of the next-generation PJ. That said, this repo WILL be watched, so any modifications or suggestions
made by others will not go unnoticed.

This was all written in Java, using Notepad++ as the primary text editor. Notepad++ may do weird things with the
formatting, as well as my habit of using TAB to indent lines, and if it hinders readability I'm sorry. I am
currently in the process of breaking this habit (but using Notepad++ makes it so convenient to use TAB!) so as
to limit these formatting issues. Future code documents should be okay.

I hope you will find my profusion of comments helpful. All suggestions, criticisms, and modifications welcome.
