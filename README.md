original Pokemon Java files from Spring 2012 (text-based)

Initially, this contains all the files used in development of our first version of PJ, which was being designed
as a purely text-based game. The plan is to pretty much scrap this version, now that we've decided to GUI, and
rebuild our game using this version as more or less reference material.

Currently (11pm on a Tuesday night), this is not an organized repo. When I find the time, I will organize it into subfolders and such.

I hope you will find my profusion of comments helpful. All suggestions welcome.
